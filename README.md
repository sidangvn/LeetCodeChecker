# LeetCodeChecker

Run the app with: LeetCode Checker.exe

Windows will aware you that this app is not safe. Just hit Learn More and then Run Anyway.


After your first run the app, a directory of this app will be created in C:\LeetCode. It will have 3 files, Questions - this file contains LeetCode Questions, QuestionsClone - this
file is a copy of Questions, Register - this file contains the key for the app to start with Windows. If you do not have LeetCode questions, you can use the Questions.txt in the
code file in this respo and replace the Questions.txt in C:\LeetCode\.

If you can not run the app, please download .NET framework on Microsoft website (just Bing and it will show up). P/S: do not Google it because I love Bing more.

While you first run the app, Windows will say this app is not safe but for sure, it is safe. Just hit "Run Anyway" and enjoy my app which was created in just 2 days. I am sure that there are a lot of bugs, I have not tried to fix any bugs, I will try to fix bugs when I have time.

Thank you and please fix bugs if you love C# and .NET.
